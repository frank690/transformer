## What is left to do?

- [ ] Implement data preprocessing
    - [ ] Download data
    - [ ] Tokenization
    - [ ] Create dataset / data loader
- [ ] Implement positional encoding
- [ ] Implement transformer encoder
- [ ] Implement transformer decoder
- [ ] Implement training routine


## What data is used?
German-English translation dataset (WMT17) is used. 
The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html#download).
